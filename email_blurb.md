London Data Week centres residents in conversations, events, and decisions about data. 
Through a week of activities across the city, we aim to foster public conversations about data and raise interest and awareness, 
as well as empowerment for Londoners to use data to enrich their lives. 
Are you (or is your organisation) interested in delivering an event during LDW23?
